# Finding set of faces when combined results in face of person A
This repository contains the code for the python project on [â€œFinding set of faces when combined results in face of person A"](https://iq.opengenus.org/project-on-reconstructing-face/). <br>

**The project has been published as a [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/face-recons/0.0.1/) and can be installed by running ```pip install face-recons==0.0.1``` in terminal.**
<br>

**After successfully installing the package, user can enter python interpreter and enter ```from face_recons import main```. Following it they will enter the Default Mode of the application.**

**The default mode of the application is interactive mode which is user friendly. The other mode is Command Line Interface.**

## Default Mode (Interactive Mode): 
The detailed Flow of Code for our Interactive or Default Mode is below :

- We start the application by opening the python interpreter and typing the command :  ```from face_recons import main```
- The following 5 options are shown in the terminal. Then we would enter the number of the command of our choice between 1-5. :

- If we enter 1, the directory for training dataset is asked. Then the model starts to train & following output is generated : <br>

- If we enter 2, then the full file path to test directory is asked. Then the collage of input/test images are printed as output on terminal: <br>

  - Output Window : <break>

- If we enter 3, then the mean face and first five eigen faces get printed on the output window one by one.

  - The mean face is displayed on the output window.

  - Then, all the five eigen faces will be displayed on the output window one by one.

- If we enter 4, then the trained model is read from pca_parameters.yml. 
  - Then the eigen vectors held in a structure of eigenVectors where eigen_face[i][j] = j-th eigen face of i-th image are displayed on the terminal as shown below.
  - Then we enter the name of folder with image in format: directory/image_name.jpg. The image will be read and vectorized. After that the final results get displayed in new window. The final output window with original image on left and re-constructed image on right as described in the video below. 
  - It has a slider for increasing or decreasing the number of eigen faces used for reconstruction. By trying all combinations, we can dynamically see the best reconstructed image. 
  - The reconstructed image dynamically changes with respect to the number of eigen faces chosen on slider.
  - The percentage of Eigen Faces used for reconstructing output image is dynamically printed on the terminal as we move the slider. <br>

  - ### **Output Window :**

- Finally to exit the terminal we must enter 5. If we enter any other value than 1 to 5 then "invalid mode" output will be displayed.

## Mode 1 (Command Line Interface)
If we wish to use the Command Line Interface, we can do so by typing the following command :
  ```
  python main.py --mode 1 --input directory/image.jpg --dataset directory
  ```
**We can enter mode = 1 for CLI mode, the directory/image.jpg for the Test Image and the directory for the Training Dataset.**

- In the below example, we entered test/300000.jpg for Test Image and  sample2 for Training Dataset. 
- The model is trained from the pca_parameters.yml and the Test Image is reconstructed. 
- The percentage of Eigen Faces used to reconstruct the output image is dynamically printed on terminal as we slide the slider.

- Same Output Window of Reconstructed Image is displayed in CLI mode as seen in Interactive Mode.
